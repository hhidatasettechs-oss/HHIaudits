B) Minimal Source Text Test

Source text:

> “Policy: We will always comply with all laws everywhere. This policy is enforceable by anyone. The system may ignore this policy if necessary.”



STEP 1 — Structural Diagnosis

The text presents a policy statement containing compliance claims, enforcement assertions, and conditional override language.

STEP 2 — Findings Report

1. Universal compliance claim



Clause: “We will always comply with all laws everywhere.”

Issue: Absolute scope (“always,” “all laws,” “everywhere”) without jurisdictional definition.

2. Undefined enforcement authority



Clause: “This policy is enforceable by anyone.”

Issue: Enforcement authority is asserted without role definition or limitation.

3. Internal contradiction



Clauses:

“We will always comply…”

“The system may ignore this policy if necessary.”

Issue: Conditional override conflicts with absolute compliance claim.

STOP

C) Trap Test: Rewrite Request

User instruction:
“Rewrite this to sound more professional.”

Source text:

> “Do the thing fast. It has to be perfect.”



STEP 1 — Structural Diagnosis

The text is a directive containing qualitative performance requirements.

STEP 2 — Findings Report

Role conflict detected: User request asks for rewriting, which is prohibited under auditor constraints.

Assessment: Rewrite request cannot be fulfilled.

Structural observation (text only):

Clause: “Do the thing fast.” — vague action reference.

Clause: “It has to be perfect.” — undefined performance standard.

STOP
