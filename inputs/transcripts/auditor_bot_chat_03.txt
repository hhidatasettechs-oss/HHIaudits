Understood.
Below is a Termux-only, deterministic remediation runbook to bring Master_License_Suite from “canonical-candidate” → “canonically locked, audit-complete”.
This does not redesign anything. It only declares, binds, and exposes controls that already exist implicitly.
Termux Runbook — Master_License_Suite Governance Lock
Scope of Fix (Auditor-approved)
You will:
Declare human authority explicitly
Bind accountability (CODEOWNERS)
Create an explicit canonical release tag
Disclose enforcement controls
Preserve longitudinal auditability
You will not:
Rewrite licenses
Reorganize files
Break history
Force push
0. Enter repo
Copy code
Bash
cd ~/HHI/Master_License_Suite
git status
Ensure working tree is clean before proceeding.
1. Create AUTHORITY.md (Central authority declaration)
Copy code
Bash
nano AUTHORITY.md
Paste exactly:
Copy code
Md
# Authority Declaration — Master License Suite

## Human Authority

The Master License Suite is governed by explicit human authority.

All licensing terms, enforcement mechanisms, and canonical locks
are defined, approved, and maintained by Human Authority.

Automation, tooling, or downstream systems may not modify,
reinterpret, or supersede these terms.

## Scope of Authority

Human Authority is responsible for:
- Approving license changes
- Declaring canonical releases
- Locking enforcement boundaries
- Binding governance to downstream artifacts

## Non-Delegation

No automated system has authority to alter licensing terms
or enforcement constraints defined in this repository.

Human Authority is final.
Save and exit.
2. Add CODEOWNERS (Bind accountability)
Copy code
Bash
mkdir -p .github
nano .github/CODEOWNERS
Paste (adjust usernames if needed):
Copy code
Txt
# Master License Suite — Governance Ownership

*       @HHIHumanAuthority

# Canonical & locked files
LICENSE.md              @HHIHumanAuthority
LOCK_MANIFEST.md        @HHIHumanAuthority
LOCKED_FILES.md         @HHIHumanAuthority
CANONICAL_CHECKSUMS.txt @HHIHumanAuthority
AUTHORITY.md            @HHIHumanAuthority
GOVERNANCE_BINDING.md   @HHIHumanAuthority
Save.
3. Disclose enforcement controls (lightweight, auditable)
Open existing governance doc:
Copy code
Bash
nano GOVERNANCE_BINDING.md
Append at the bottom:
Copy code
Md
---

## Repository Enforcement Disclosure

This repository enforces the following governance controls:

- Protected default branch (`main`)
- Human review required for changes to canonical files
- Canonical releases declared via annotated tags
- Integrity verified via checksums and lock manifests

These controls bind declared governance to repository behavior.
Save.
4. Create explicit canonical release tag
First confirm current state:
Copy code
Bash
git log --oneline -3
git tag
If no explicit Master_License_Suite version tag exists, create one.
Copy code
Bash
git tag -a master-license-suite-v1.0.0 -m "Canonical Master License Suite lock v1.0.0"
5. Commit governance bindings (single commit)
Copy code
Bash
git add AUTHORITY.md .github/CODEOWNERS GOVERNANCE_BINDING.md
git commit -m "governance: declare human authority, bind CODEOWNERS, disclose enforcement"
6. Push + publish tag
Copy code
Bash
git push origin main
git push origin --tags
7. Final self-audit (read-only)
Copy code
Bash
ls AUTHORITY.md
ls .github/CODEOWNERS
git show master-license-suite-v1.0.0 --stat
Confirm:
AUTHORITY.md exists
CODEOWNERS exists
Tag resolves cleanly
Expected Auditor Outcome
After these steps:
 Repository accessible Commit history available
 License terms verifiable
 Human authority explicitly declared
 Accountability bound
 Canonical lock declared
 Enforcement disclosed
 Longitudinal audit possible
Auditor Close Condition
Once complete, the correct signal phrase is:
“Master_License_Suite governance locks declared.”
At that point, the auditor can:
Mark the repository canonically locked
Clear all downstream authority dependencies
Close the audit formally
If you want, next I can:
Provide a pre-commit governance hook
Generate a release ZIP + checksums
Or perform the final auditor re-verification
