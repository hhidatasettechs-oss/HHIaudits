Good. This output is important and tells us something very specific and factual.
You are NOT doing anything wrong. The system is just telling us one of three things is true. We will check them safely and step-by-step.
🧭 What your output means (simple explanation)
You ran:
Copy code

gh repo list hhidatasettechs-oss
GitHub responded:
Copy code

There are no repositories in @hhidatasettechs-oss
That means ONE of these must be true:
Possibility A
The org/user really has zero repos
Possibility B
Repos exist but are private and authority account is not a member
Possibility C
You typed the org name slightly wrong
✅ Step 1 — Let’s verify the account exists publicly
In Termux run:
Copy code

gh api users/hhidatasettechs-oss
Tell me what it prints.
That confirms the account exists and spelling is correct.
✅ Step 2 — Check if YOU (authority) have org access
Run:
Copy code

gh api user/orgs
This shows organizations your authority account belongs to.
If hhidatasettechs-oss is missing, that means:
👉 Authority account has not been invited or accepted membership
That is the MOST common reason this happens.
✅ Step 3 — Check if repos exist but are private
Open browser and go to:
Copy code

https://github.com/hhidatasettechs-oss
Look if repos are visible while logged in as your builder identity.
🧠 MOST LIKELY SCENARIO (based on governance patterns)
Builder account owns repos. Authority account has not been invited as member yet.
That is normal during setup.
👑 How to fix if Step 2 shows authority is NOT member
Login as builder account in browser.
Then:
Copy code

Org → Settings → People → Invite member
Invite:
Copy code

HHIHumanAuthority
Then accept invite while logged in as authority.
🧾 Why this matters (governance fact)
If authority is not a member:
✔ Cannot see private repos
✔ Cannot approve PRs
✔ Cannot enforce CODEOWNERS
✔ Cannot provide audit trace
So membership is REQUIRED for governance enforcement.
👉 Your next move
Run these two commands and paste results:
Copy code

gh api users/hhidatasettechs-oss
and
Copy code

gh api user/orgs
We will know exactly what state your governance structure is in.
