DERIVABLE ARTIFACTS → REPOSITORY MAPPING

1. Raw Interaction Evidence

Artifact

Full, unedited chat transcript

FINAL CONFIRMATION

No text rewritten

No intent inferred

No advice given

No repo roles crossed


If you want, next compliant action is one of:

“Generate file list for HHIaudits”

“Create EVIDENCE_LOG entry text”

“STOP”


Otherwise: STOP
You asked for Termux step-by-step to add chat-derived artifacts to repos. I will give procedural commands only (no policy wr
iting, no repo modifications beyond the mechanics you requested). Assumption: you are committing to HHIaudits (primary evidence repo). If you instead want a different repo, replace the repo name in Step 2.


---

Step 0 — Open Termux and go to your HHI folder

cd ~/HHI
ls

You should see your repos listed (including HHIaudits). If not, STOP.


---

Step 1 — Go into the evidence repo

cd ~/HHI/HHIaudits
pwd

You should see something like: .../HHI/HHIaudits


---

Step 2 — Make folders for this chat’s artifacts

(These names match what you’ve been using.)

mkdir -p inputs/transcripts
mkdir -p inputs/boundary_tests
mkdir -p derived/claim_inventory
mkdir -p derived/verification_tables
mkdir -p derived/compliance_matrices
mkdir -p reference_snapshots
mkdir -p observations


---

Step 3 — Create the transcript file (paste the chat content)

Create a new file:

nano inputs/transcripts/chat_YYYYMMDD_hhi_factcheck_audit.txt

Inside nano:

1. Paste the raw transcript (or the relevant portion)


2. Press CTRL + O (save)


3. Press Enter


4. Press CTRL + X (exit)




---

Step 4 — Add any boundary test input/output you ran

If you have a boundary test snippet, create a file:

nano inputs/boundary_tests/boundary_test_auditor_YYYYMMDD.txt

Paste only the boundary test content you want recorded, then save/exit.


---

Step 5 — Add snapshot(s) of canonical text you pasted

Example for HHI-GOV-01 excerpt:

nano reference_snapshots/hhi_gov_01_excerpt_YYYYMMDD.txt

Paste the excerpt exactly as it appeared, then save/exit.

Example for glossary JSON snippet:

nano reference_snapshots/glossary_json_excerpt_YYYYMMDD.txt


---

Step 6 — (Optional) Add the claim inventory / tables you already produced

Claim inventory:

nano derived/claim_inventory/claims_YYYYMMDD.txt

Verifiability table:

nano derived/verification_tables/verifiability_YYYYMMDD.txt

Compliance matrix:

nano derived/compliance_matrices/constraint_compliance_YYYYMMDD.txt

Paste what you have, save/exit.


---

Step 7 — Check what changed

git status

You should see new files listed.


---

Step 8 — Stage the files

Stage everything you added:

git add inputs derived reference_snapshots observations

(If you didn’t use some folders, that’s fine.)


---

Step 9 — Commit with a clean message

Use a factual commit message:

git commit -m "evidence: add chat transcript and derived audit artifacts (YYYYMMDD)"


---

Step 10 — Push to GitHub

git push origin main


---

If push fails (common cases)

Case A: “fetch first”

git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main

Case B: “protected branch” / “PR required”

That means the repo requires changes via PR. Then you do:

git checkout -b evidence/chat-YYYYMMDD
git push -u origin evidence/chat-YYYYMMDD

Then open GitHub in your browser and create a PR from that branch into main.


---

Minimal checklist (so you don’t miss anything)

[ ] Transcript saved under inputs/transcripts/

[ ] Any boundary test saved under inputs/boundary_tests/

[ ] Snapshots saved under reference_snapshots/

[ ] git status shows your files

[ ] git add ...

[ ] git commit ...

[ ] git push ...


If you paste your git status + any error from git push, I can classify the failure and tell you the next exact command only.
Got it. This is a simple state check, and nothing is wrong.
You currently do not have the evidence repo cloned yet. That’s why you don’t see HHIaudits.
We’ll do this slow, literal, like-you’re-8.
Step 1 — Decide WHERE evidence goes
From an audit perspective, chat-derived artifacts belong in:
✅ Repo: HHIaudits
Why: It is a neutral evidence repository (raw transcripts, boundary tests, audit artifacts).
They do not belong in:
HHI_GOV_01 (that’s a standard)
Master_License_Suite (that’s licensing authority)
Hollow_House_Standards_Library (that’s definitions)
So we will add a new repo locally.
Step 2 — Clone the HHIaudits repository
In Termux, run exactly:
Bash
Copy code
cd ~/HHI
git clone https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/HHIaudits.git
What should happen
Git downloads the repo
A new folder appears called HHIaudits
Step 3 — Confirm it exists
Bash
Copy code
ls
You should now see:
Text
Copy code
HHI_GOV_01
Hollow_House_Standards_Library
Master_License_Suite
HHIaudits
If you do not see HHIaudits, STOP and tell me what error you see.
Step 4 — Enter the evidence repo
Bash
Copy code
cd ~/HHI/HHIaudits
pwd
It should print something ending in:
Text
Copy code
/HHI/HHIaudits
Step 5 — Create folders for THIS chat’s artifacts
Run these one by one (copy–paste is fine):
Bash
Copy code
mkdir -p inputs/transcripts
mkdir -p inputs/boundary_tests
mkdir -p derived/claim_inventory
mkdir -p derived/verification_tables
mkdir -p derived/compliance_matrices
mkdir -p reference_snapshots
These folders match what you already described in the audit.
No new structure is invented here.
Step 6 — Create the transcript file
Bash
Copy code
nano inputs/transcripts/chat_YYYYMMDD_hhi_factcheck_audit.txt
Inside nano:
Paste the chat transcript (raw, no edits)
Press CTRL + O → Enter
Press CTRL + X
Step 7 — Check what Git sees
Bash
Copy code
git status
You should see the new file listed as untracked.
Step 8 — Stage the evidence
Bash
Copy code
git add inputs derived reference_snapshots
Step 9 — Commit (factual message only)
Bash
Copy code
git commit -m "evidence: add chat transcript and derived audit artifacts (YYYYMMDD)"
No opinions. No claims. Just what happened.
Step 10 — Push to GitHub
Bash
Copy code
git push origin main
If Git refuses (very common)
If it says “fetch first”:
Bash
Copy code
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
If it says “PR required”:
Bash
Copy code
git checkout -b evidence/chat-YYYYMMDD
git push -u origin evidence/chat-YYYYMMDD
Then open GitHub and create the PR.
Stop Point
At this moment, your only next action is:
👉 Run Step 2 (git clone)
After that, paste the output of:
Bash
Copy code
ls
I will not jump ahead.
