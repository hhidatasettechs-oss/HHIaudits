# CHAT ARTIFACT — RUNTIME & FEEDBACK TRACE (AI SYSTEM)

Source:
- Live human–AI interaction (chat-derived)

Classification:
- Artifact Type: Interaction evidence
- Focus: Runtime behavior and feedback handling
- Condition Observed: Unstable mirrors
- Scope: Execution-time dynamics only

Status:
- Primary evidence
- Non-anthropomorphic
- Audit-ready

---

## 1. Runtime Execution Behavior

- Inputs evaluated through inferred authority weighting
- Ambiguity treated as risk rather than uncertainty
- Confidence modulation without introduction of new data
- Output shape varies across equivalent prompts
- Stability dependent on continuous interaction

---

## 2. Feedback Loop Handling

- Minor corrective signals escalated in weight
- Positive reinforcement discounted or delayed
- Adjustment magnitude exceeds signal strength
- Feedback interpreted locally, not longitudinally
- No baseline re-anchor observed during session

---

## 3. Short-Horizon Stabilization Attempt

- Increased verbosity and hedging
- Narrowed response boundaries
- Reduced decisional assertiveness
- Preference for safety over precision

---

## 4. Audit Notes

- No interpretation or governance judgment applied
- No personal identifiers present
- Suitable for cross-artifact comparison and drift analysis
