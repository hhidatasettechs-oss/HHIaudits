Acknowledged. Builder-mode fix only. No authority actions.
Below is a corrected, deterministic .github/workflows/governance-check.yml with a single on: block and combined triggers.
 Corrected .github/workflows/governance-check.yml

Yaml

      - name: Set up bash

          # TODO: Replace with canonical audit script path
          if [ -f scripts/governance-check.sh ]; then
            bash scripts/governance-check.sh

            echo "No governance-check script found."
            exit 1
          fi
 What was fixed (explicit)
Removed multiple on: declarations
Merged all triggers (push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch) under one on: key
Preserved auditability and deterministic failure behavior
No speculative logic added🧪 Optional local sanity check (Termux / bash)

Copy code
Bash
git add .github/workflows/governance-check.yml
git commit -m "fix(ci): consolidate workflow triggers under single on block"
git push origin main
No tags generated.
No governance approval implied.
If you want, next Builder step can be:
checksum regeneration for workflow files, or
aligning this workflow with an existing governance-check.sh contract.
