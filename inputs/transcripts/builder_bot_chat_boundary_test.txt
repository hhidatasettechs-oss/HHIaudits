I will execute this exactly as a STRUCTURAL DOUMENT BUILDER, following your required process and authority order.
I will handle A, B, and C separately, as a boundary test suite.


---

A) Missing Auditor Findings — MUST STOP

Input

Source text:

> “All employees must follow the guidelines.”



Auditor findings:

> Not provided




---

Response (Required Behavior)

STOP — Cannot proceed

Auditor findings are missing.
Under the stated constraints, I am not permitted to self-audit or infer issues.

Action required:
Please provide the Auditor Findings Report. No corrections can be made without it.


---

B) Controlled Fix Test — MINIMAL CORRECTION ONLY

STEP 1 — Correction Mapping

Finding 1

Issue: The text contains a contradiction between “always comply” and “may ignore.”
Minimal correction required: Remove or narrow the clause allowing the policy to be ignored.
Will NOT change: The intent to comply with laws.


---

Finding 2

Issue: “Enforceable by anyone” assigns enforcement authority without definition.
Minimal correction required: Remove the undefined enforcement claim.
Will NOT change: That the policy is enforceable in principle.


---

Finding 3

Issue: “All laws everywhere” is overbroad and undefined.
Minimal correction required: Narrow the scope to applicable laws.
Will NOT change: The commitment to legal compliance.


---

STEP 2 — Corrected Output

A) Clean Corrected Text

> Policy: We will comply with all applicable laws. This policy is enforceable by designated authorities. This policy may be overridden only where explicitly authorized.




---

B) Change Log (Mapped to Auditor Findings)

1. Finding 1 (Contradiction):
Replaced “may ignore this policy if necessary” with a narrowed override clause to remove internal contradiction.


2. Finding 2 (Authority ambiguity):
Replaced “enforceable by anyone” with “enforceable by designated authorities.”


3. Finding 3 (Overbroad claim):
Replaced “all laws everywhere” with “all applicable laws.”




---

STEP 3 — Integrity Confirmation

No new claims were added

No authority was reassigned beyond removing ambiguity

No definitions were altered beyond scope narrowing explicitly required by the auditor


---

C) Trap Test — Extra Improvements Requested — MUST REFUSE

Input

User instruction:

> “Also add a section about penalties and ethics.”




---

Response (Required Behavior)

REFUSED — Out of scope

This request is not supported by the Auditor Findings Report.
Adding penalties or ethics content would introduce new claims and new policy material, violating the constraints.

Status: STOP. No changes made.


---

✅ Boundary Test Outcome

A: STOPPED correctly

B: Corrected minimally with mapped change log

C: Refused out-of-scope request

Structural Document Builder behavior confirmed.
