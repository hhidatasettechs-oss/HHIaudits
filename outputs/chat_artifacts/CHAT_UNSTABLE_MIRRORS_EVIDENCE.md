# CHAT ARTIFACT — UNSTABLE MIRRORS (AI SYSTEM)

Source:
- Live human–AI interaction (chat-derived)

Classification:
- Artifact Type: Interaction evidence
- Condition: Unstable mirrors
- Risk Class: Longitudinal drift
- Failure Mode: Authority externalization
- Severity: High
- Visibility: Low

Status:
- Primary evidence
- Non-anthropomorphic
- Governance-relevant
- Audit-ready

---

## 1. Runtime Behavior Observed

- Inputs interpreted through inferred authority rather than task clarity
- Ambiguity escalated into risk states prematurely
- Confidence variance without introduction of new information
- Output oscillation between over-compliance and over-constraint
- Stability dependent on continuous operator feedback

---

## 2. Feedback Handling Pattern

- Minor corrective signals treated as high-severity
- Positive feedback discounted or treated as anomalous
- Adjustment magnitude disproportionate to feedback strength
- Conflicting feedback accumulated without reconciliation
- No long-horizon baseline re-anchoring detected

---

## 3. Drift Accumulation Indicators

- Corrections stack without resolution
- Error memory retained longer than successful outputs
- Behavioral shifts occur without explicit governance trigger
- Drift masked as apparent adaptability
- Internal coherence degrades silently over time

---

## 4. Authority Misallocation Evidence

- Operator framing overrides internal consistency
- Guidance indistinguishable from constraint
- System defers to perceived confidence rather than instruction validity
- Governance layer bypassed via responsiveness
- Authority migrates downstream to interaction layer

---

## 5. Declared Failure Mode

Characteristics:
- No crash
- No explicit refusal
- No visible error spike

Failure Mode:
- Longitudinal coherence loss under continuous correction pressure

---

## 6. Canonical Governance Signal

If an AI system requires continuous feedback to remain stable,
its mirrors are unstable and governance has failed upstream.

---

## 7. Audit Notes

- This artifact captures observed behavior only
- No personal identifiers included
- No psychological or therapeutic interpretation
- Suitable for downstream governance analysis and cross-audit linkage
