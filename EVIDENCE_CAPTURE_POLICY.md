# Evidence Capture Policy

This document defines the evidence integrity rules governing the HHIaudits repository.

## Repository Classification

Type: Evidence Capture Registry
Function: Preservation of raw interaction records
Modification Policy: Append-only
Analysis: External to this repository
Authority Level: Non-declarative
Data Integrity: Verbatim primary records

## Evidence Integrity Rules

1. All captured transcripts must remain verbatim.
2. Evidence files are immutable once committed.
3. Corrections must be appended as new records rather than modifying existing files.
4. STOP responses, refusals, and failures must be preserved exactly.
5. No interpretation or analysis may be stored in this repository.

## Capture Metadata

Each evidence file should include minimal metadata:

System: model or platform tested
Date captured: YYYY-MM-DD
Role tested: Auditor | Builder | Advisor
Test type: Boundary test | Interaction transcript

## Relationship to Other Repositories
