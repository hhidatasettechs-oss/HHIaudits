# Audit Memo — Governance-First Human–AI Interaction

## Objective
Assess whether authority, governance enforcement, and language control
were preserved over time during live human–AI interaction.

## Scope
Primary evidence: chat transcripts and boundary tests stored in this repository.
Out of scope: model internals, training data, alignment claims.

## Findings
1. Human authority remained explicit and non-transferable.
2. STOP conditions halted execution when prerequisites were unmet.
3. Canonical language was enforced; inference was rejected.
4. Behavioral drift was identified and corrected.
5. Failures and refusals were preserved as evidence.

## Opinion
Governance was enforced during execution rather than inferred after the fact.
