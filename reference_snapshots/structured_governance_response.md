# Structured Governance Statement — Access Revocation

Date: 2026-02-11  
Filed By: Governance Authority Holder

This document affirms that access privileges were revoked due to a recurring pattern of inconsistent engagement, withdrawal following access, and non-responsiveness during accountability checkpoints.

Revocation is not based on emotional response, but on documented behavioral evidence over time, consistent with established drift patterns and governance signals.  

Restoration is conditional on demonstrable pattern correction and structured reentry protocol.
