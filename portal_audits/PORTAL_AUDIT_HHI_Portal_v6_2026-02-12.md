## Audit Scope

This audit covers:

- Archive extraction and file inventory
- Structural coherence and separation of concerns
- Authority and licensing signal presence (surface-level)

## Structural Governance Assessment

### Observations

- Clear separation between presentation, logic, configuration, and legal surfaces
- Presence of README indicates declared intent surface
- Config-driven dataset and benchmark references reduce hard-coded coupling
- Nested evaluation artifact present

### Assessment

- Structure is coherent and non-chaotic
- No hidden or obfuscated files detected
- Static delivery model reduces silent execution drift

**Status:** PASS

---

## Authority & Licensing Signals

### Observed

- Dedicated `legal.html` and `licensing.html` present
- No external authority implied at filename or directory level
- Licensing authority not yet validated at content level (out of scope)

**Status:** PRESENT BUT UNVERIFIED  
**Risk Level:** Low

---

## Versioning Discipline

### Signals Detected

- Portal version implied by archive name: `v6`
- Nested artifact references `HHI_SRS_v2_0_0`

### Risk Identified

- Potential ambiguity between portal versioning and dataset suite versioning
- No explicit binding statement observed at structural level

**Classification:** Version Coupling Risk  
**Severity:** Low

---

## Drift & Governance Illusion Risk

### Positive Controls

- Static architecture
- Config-based references
- No server-side execution implied

### Risk Indicators

- `app.js` as a single aggregation point
- UI may be mistaken for governance enforcement if used beyond presentation

**Classification:** Context-dependent risk  
**Severity:** Conditional

---

## Nested Artifact Flag

**File:** `HHI_SRS_v2_0_0_Eval.zip`  
**Size:** 20 bytes

### Assessment

- Size suggests placeholder, sentinel, or non-functional payload
- Purpose cannot be inferred safely

**Status:** REQUIRES EXPLICIT CLARIFICATION  
**Risk:** Misinterpretation if relied upon

---

## Audit Verdict

### Result

🟢 **CONDITIONAL PASS**

The package is structurally sound and governance-aware.  
No execution-time drift or authority violations were observed.

### Conditions Outstanding

1. Content-level authority confirmation (README / legal / licensing)
2. Clarification of nested ZIP purpose
3. Explicit version-binding statement between portal and datasets

---

## Stop Authority Statement

No corrective actions were executed.  
No assumptions were made beyond observed structure.  
Audit stopped at declared scope boundary.
